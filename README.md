# SQL_Module9_Challenge_KNOVAK

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time review my Module 9 Challenge.

# CSV Data
- In the folder labeled , you can find the .csv files of the data pulled to import into the tables created on the .sql files

# Data Engineering & Data Analysis
- In the folder labled .SQL Code, you can find my .sql coding for both TableCreationSchema & Module9_DataAnalysis_Queries_KNovak. TableCreaionSchema is the code I used for creating tables and building my database diagram on QuickDBD. Module9_DataAnalysis_Queries_KNovak highlights the coding process of gathering the questions listed below...

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee. (300,024 Results)

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986. (36,150 Results)

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name. (24 Results)

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name. (331,603 Results)

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B. (20 Results)

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name. (52,245 Results

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name. (137,952 Results)

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name). (1,638 Results)

# Data Modeling
- In the folder labled Data Modeling you will find a png file labeled QuickDBD_KNOVAK of the Database Diagram I created for this assignment. You will also find a .sql file with the code I used to create the Database Diagram.

Please let me know if you should have any questions.

Cheers,
